## About

**The storm is coming!** Help the frogs return to their habitat through the forest by clearing the path for them.

Frog This Way is a Lemmings-style puzzle game where players guide a continuous stream of frogs from point A to point B. The climate is disrupted, a violent storm is approaching, and the frogs need to reach their ancestral ruins for shelter.

**Gameplay:**
- God-game perspective with top-down isometric view
- Interact with the environment using mouse-only controls
- Click and drag natural elements to redirect frog paths
- Complete casual mini-games to unlock alternative routes
- Collect sap along the way to restore the ancestral ruins
- Progressive storm atmosphere with rain, wind, and thunder

The game features 8 levels with increasing difficulty and atmosphere intensity as the storm approaches.
